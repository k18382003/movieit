# Project Title

[MovieIt](https://k18382003.github.io/movieit/)

## Overview

Have you ever experienced frustration when you couldn't find someone who shares your passion for movies? Have there been moments when you wanted to watch a Marvel movie, but none of your friends or family were fans of it? MovieIt provides a platform for connecting with individuals who share your movie preferences! Discover a new movie companion in your local area through MovieIt, and enjoy having someone to exchange thoughts and feedback on the films you both love.

### Problem

Once, a colleague shared that he went to watch a movie alone the previous night because his wife wasn't interested in that particular film. Similarly, in group chats with my friends, there are instances when someone suggests going to the movies together, but occasionally, either no one is available at that time or simply not interested.
This leads me to consider the possibility of a platform that, based on your current location or neighborhood, helps you connect with someone who shares your interests and is available to join you for a movie when you want to. Unlike dating apps, it doesn't focus on finding significant others, and it's distinct from event-hosting websites with numerous categories where movies are just one of many. MovieIt has a clear and uncomplicated mission: to connect individuals with similar movie interests.
